                        <p>Well it's a vertical slice of the game Ultrakill as a school assignment.
                            We chose to make the first part of the first level for how much time we had and the artists we had available at the time.
                            For what we about had 3~ ish months for the make.
                           The group consisted out of 4 Game Developers and 3 Artists of which i was the Lead Dev

                        <h3>What I did in the project</h3>
                        <p>
                            I mainly worked on the UI to make it as close to UltraKill as I could through design and how it worked. 
                            Finding audio files to use in the game like the soundtrack, Gunshots, Walking, etc. through The gamefiles of UltraKill itself.

                        <h3>Quick summary of UltraKill</h3> 
                        <p>
                            UltraKill is a face pace 'boomer shooter' about a robot named V1 Searching for blood in hell. 
                            I personally LOVE this game. I have put 200 hours into it on my own and have played it before this project started.
                            In this project I wanted to make the UI for this accurate but for how much time we had wasn't perfect
                        </p>

                        <br>

                        <h2>Coding and such</h2>
                        <p>
                            honestly for this project i didn't really have a lot of coding to do. 
                            So i just did all the design parts like sounds grabbing ingame screenshots to compare to especially for our artists who needed it.
                            Sometimes i made a texture if our artists didn't have enough time. 
                            but what i did was much HUD and UI design. Like the pause screen. Main Screen and some parts of the deathscreen
                        </p>
