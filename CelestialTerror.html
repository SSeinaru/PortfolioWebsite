                        <p>Well This was the first group assignment we received out of school.
                            We decided as a group to make a first person point and click adventure that took place in
                            space on the old soviet spacestation We had 2 developers and 4 Artists available to us on
                            which I again was elected the Lead Developer.

                        Well i made the ability to feel like you are walking around.
                        Placing the soundeffects in the game made by one of the artists.
                        While also making the interactions with the things around the rooms and 'map'.
                        With the interactables the text box that pops up when you do.

                    <p>
                        As a simple explanation this is the main function of the entire 3 scripts I have to make
                        this functional. What its about it calls the GameObject known as SceneChange and then selects
                        the 'Rooms' from an enum i have. Specifically this one.
                    </p>
                    <div class="projectFeatureImageContainer">
                        <img src="images/CelestialMove/RoomManager1.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        And afterwards calls to the SceneChangeManager to make it go smoothly and work all of what
                        it needs to do.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The SceneChangeManager</h2>

                    <div class="projectFeatureImageContainer">
                        <img src="images/CelestialMove/RoomManager2.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This is pretty self explanatory. These are all the variables the script needs to function
                        properly
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="featureExplenationPart">
                    <p>
                        And then comes the actual brains of this entire script
                    </p>
                    <div class="projectFeatureImageContainer">
                        <img src="images/CelestialMove/RoomManager3.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        What this does is basically change the rooms in the background making it look more smooth
                        from the player perspective. First it checks if the ChangeState is not 'END'. and if it isn't it
                        checks if the timer isn't smaller than 0 and the change state is stil not 'END'.
                        Then everything checks out to be fine. It sets the timer back to 0. It turns off the
                        SceneChange GameObject.And at the end puts the ChangeState to 'END'.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then in the same script the second part if the timer is bigger than 0 but still smaller than
                        1 AND the ChangeState is not 'MIDDLE'. It searched for the ROoms GameObject and makes a local
                        variable named 'all'. After that it sets 2 more local variables named FromRoomL and targetRoom
                        and sets them to fromRoom and toRoom. After finding the targetRoom it sets it active and turns
                        the FromRoomL off. and after that it sets the ChangeState to 'MIDDLE'.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="featureExplenationPart">
                    <p> And then after all that the code on the rooms themselves for example this one is for
                        Hydroponics
                    </p>
                    <div class="featureExplenationPart">
                        <img src="images/CelestialMove/CodeOfRooms.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        What this does is pretty self explanitory after all of what i explained.
                        It has a variable for the SceneChange Gameobject and roomLogic Then in the start() it searches
                        for the ROoms GameObject and grabs the RoomLogic Component on it And after that it makes
                        functions with the roomLogic to use in buttons for the point and click part of the game.
                    </p>
