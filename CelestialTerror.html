                        <p>Well This was the first group assignment we received out of school. 
                            We decided as a group to make a first person point and click adventure that took place in space on the old soviet spacestation
                            We had 2 developers and 4 Artists available to us on which I again was elected the Lead Developer.      
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>What I did in the project</h3>
                        <p>
                            Well i made the ability to feel like you are walking around.
                            Placing the soundeffects in the game made by one of the artists. 
                            While also making the interactions with the things around the rooms and 'map'. 
                            With the interactables the text box that pops up when you do.

                        <h2>The code of The room change</h2>

                        <img src="images/CelestialMove/RoomLogic.png">
                        <p>
                            As a simple explination this is the main function of the entire 3 scripts I have to make this functional.
                            What its about it calls the GameObject known as SceneChange and then selects the 'Rooms' from an eNUM i have.
                            Specifically this one
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/CelestialMove/RoomManager1.png">
                        <p>
                            And afterwards calls to the SceneChangeManager to make it go smoothly and work all of what it needs to do.
                        </p>

                        <h2>The SceneChangeManager</h2>

                        <img src="images/CelestialMove/RoomManager2.png">
                        <p>
                            This is pretty self explinatory. These are all the variables the script needs to function properly
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            And then comes the actual brains of this entire script
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/CelestialMove/RoomManager3.png">
                        <p>
                            What this does is basically change the rooms in the background making it look more smooth from the player perspective.
                            First it checks if the ChangeState is not 'END'. and if it isn't it checks if the timer isn't smaller than 0 and the change state is stil not 'END'.
                            and if then everything checks out to be fine. It sets the timer back to 0. It turns off the SceneChange GameObject. 
                            And at the end puts the ChangeState to 'END'.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Then in the same script the second part if the timer is bigger than 0 but still smaller than 1 AND the ChangeState is not 'MIDDLE'.
                            It searched for the ROoms GameObject and makes a local variable named 'all'. 
                            After that it sets 2 more local variables named FromRoomL and targetRoom and sets them to fromRoom and toRoom.
                            After finding the targetRoom it sets it active and turns the FromRoomL off. and after that it sets the ChangeState to 'MIDDLE'.
                        </p>

                        <br> 
                        <p>And then after all that the code on the rooms themselves for example this one is for 'Hydroponics</p>
                        <img src="images/CelestialMove/CodeOfRooms.png">
                        <p>
                            What this does is pretty self explanitory after all of what i explained.
                            It has a variable for the SceneChange Gameobject and roomLogic
                            Then in the start() it searches for the ROoms GameObject and grabs the RoomLogic Component on it
                            And after that it makes functions with the roomLogic to use in buttons for the point and click part of the game.
                        </p>
