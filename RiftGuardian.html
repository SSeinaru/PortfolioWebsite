                            <h3>What the Project was about</h3>
                            <p>A VR wave shooter made in Unreal Engine. It was a fun project to work on.
                                Most fun part of this is how big the group was. It consisted of 22 People
                                18 developers and 4 artists. This project lasted for about 2 periods so 6 months
                                With me being elected as one of the lead developers again.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <h3>What I did in the project</h3>
                            <p>
                                I began by making the first edition of the shop that was later remade by someone else.
                                At a mid point in the project we realised it was too bland and too straight forward.
                                So we decided to broaden our experience and decided to work on something else.
                                I was part of the team that was reliable to make the 'World' arrow.
                                It was really fun to work on with how many things I was able to work with timelines,
                                materials, scalars, etc.
                                It was also a great learning experience.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="mainProjectDisplay">
                    <img src="images/RiftGuardian/arrow.gif" alt="">

                <div class="featureExplenationPart">
                    <h3>The Coding/Blueprint</h3>
                    <p>
                        Well let's begin at the first part, Mapping Context
                    </p>
                    <div class="projectFeatureImageContainer">
                        <img src="images/RiftGuardian/EnableInput.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p> Simply put what this does is allowing input actions when it's being held.
                        And what you do for this mapping context is the ability to break it.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="featureExplenationPart">
                    <p>
                        When you hold the arrow in 2 hands with the 2 handed script used and made in many other
                        contexts and press Y on the oculus controller it will activate the input action.
                        Which is this.
                    </p>
                    <div class="projectFeatureImageContainer">
                        <img src="images/RiftGuardian/ArrowBreak.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        While this image is not the highest quality due to sizing I can explain what it does.
                        When you break the arrow it will check if you're holding it with 2 hands and if that's true it
                        will play a sound and place 2 halves in your hands
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="featureExplenationPart">
                    <p>
                        After it's broken you have the ability to stab yourself.
                        That activates this Blueprint
                    </p>
                    <div class="projectFeatureImageContainer">
                        <img src="images/RiftGuardian/OnBeginComponent.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Well starting off once you have stabbed yourself the arrow will check if you are now the
                        parent object and it's being held by the place object.
                        And if that all succeeds you are forced to let go and it will destroy the grabComponent
                        and Collider so you can't spam the effect and can't use the arrow again and it gets forced
                        onto your chest
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="featureExplenationPart">
                    <p>
                        And after all that the arrow finally does its thing
                    </p>
                    <div class="projectFeatureImageContainer">
                        <img src="images/RiftGuardian/ArrowOpeningEffect.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This hell of a blueprint is the effect of the arrow itself.
                        So let's begin at the beginning. Its a then loop until the timelines are fully finished.
                        Every so many ticks it works through the line 'then 0 then 1 then 0 then 1, etc'.
                        Which basically makes the effect startup and after the timeline is over 1.6 it makes the
                        scalar1 reverse which reverts the colour
                        While all of that happens time starts to slow down and stop at
                        After finishing the top timeline it moves down
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="featureExplenationPart">
                    <p>
                        That looks like this
                    </p>
                    <div class="projectFeatureImageContainer">
                        <img src="images/RiftGuardian/ArrowClosingEffect.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Which doesn't change a lot from the opening except that it begins with a 10 second
                        timeline because the timestop effect lasts for 10 seconds.
                        While also starting the soundeffect for the ticktock to symbolise time.
                        After the 10 seconds is up a new sfx starts of a bell meaning time will continue and the
                        effect earlier plays again but instead making time move.
                        Instead of it stopping, with it also making the colors back to what they were
                    </p>
                </div>
